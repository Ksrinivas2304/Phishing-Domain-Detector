**Phishing Domain Detector**
Overview
This repository contains a phishing domain detector created using machine learning techniques. The detector aims to identify malicious URLs commonly associated with phishing attacks.

Features
Utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify URLs as either phishing or legitimate.
Provides a simple and efficient method to detect potentially harmful URLs.
Easy-to-use interface for integration into existing systems or applications.

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/phishing-domain-detector.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd phishing-domain-detector
Install the required dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the phishing domain detector, follow these steps:

Import the PhishingDomainDetector class from the phishing_detector.py module into your Python script or application.

Create an instance of the PhishingDomainDetector class:

python
Copy code
from phishing_detector import PhishingDomainDetector

detector = PhishingDomainDetector()
Use the detect method to classify URLs:

python
Copy code
url = "http://example.com"
result = detector.detect(url)
print("Phishing" if result else "Legitimate")
Dataset
The model was trained on a dataset containing labeled examples of phishing and legitimate URLs. The dataset used for training is not included in this repository due to its size, but a reference to it is provided in the dataset directory.
